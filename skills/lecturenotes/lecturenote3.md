# Week 3: Public records and beat reporting

### Class
* Joe Stephens, award-winning reporter for the Washington Post and expert on reporting on non-profits, will visit via Skype for the first hour of class to show us what we can learn from IRS 990 tax forms. These are key documents for reporting on universities, hospitals, charities and political organizations who are exempt from paying taxes.

* Go through reading (though we can skip Joe's story)

* Feedback on your spreadsheets: using secondary sources and social media. Should we? 

* Go back over the concept of public records now that you see the difference, and how to write a public records request. 

### Handouts 


* Three handouts on how to find the records that might help your story, which is the hardest part of the process:
 
	* [Records Guesses to Gets](findingdocs3.pdf?raw=true)
	* [Finding Records on Your Beat](beatrecords.pdf?raw=true)
	* [Avoiding Delays and Denials](foia-delay-denial.pdf?raw=true)
<br><br>


* A couple of presentations I’ve made in the past suggesting a strategy for working through records, one for [federal](federal-foia-basics.pdf?raw=true) and one for [state](statehouse_sep09.pdf?raw=true). I’ll go through one of them in class. The state level one is on North Carolina, but the same idea works in other states. That lets you try New York.

### Resources
* [Reporters' Committee for the Freedom of the Press](http://rcfp.org) has a number of resources, including [iFOIA](http://iFOIA.org) to help you submit and manage your requests; the [Open Government Guide](http://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide) which compares each state's public records laws, and provides a guide for common records; and the same type of guide for [federal FOIA](http://www.rcfp.org/federal-open-government-guide).


* Several repositories of public records can help you see what others have asked for, including [Muckrock](http://muckrock.com), the [National Security Archive](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchive/nsa/foia.htm) and a new federal [FOIA web portal from EPA](http://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home) that contains requests from several agencies 

* New York State public records help at the [Committee for Open Government](http://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/freedomfaq.html)

### Three examples (one New York, two federal government) 

* [A request for appearance enhancement establishment complaints and inspections](../resources/NYSFOIL.pdf), with the [notes](https://docs.google.com/a/columbia.edu/document/d/13q6Yu6S6u7BadX0H53cJ9nP1GMx24AEX4S4arUbS7A0/edit?usp=sharing) on the interview in which we found out what to ask for. 

* A [simple request](aroostook.pdf?raw=true) for minutes of a meeting

* A [complex request](annotated-foia-appeal.pdf?raw=true), annotated, with an appeal for a difficult dataset. (We'll return to this in our last week)
