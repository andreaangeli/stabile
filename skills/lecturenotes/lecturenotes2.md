##Lecture Notes<br>Sept. 24, 2014

[Tip sheet](../resources/backgrounding.md) is in the Resources folder.

### Section 1: Under the hood of a web site: Augie Armendariz

Augie will show us how to sleuth Internet sites, and ways to look at the underlying information. Get good at looking behind the scenes for things like keywords, hidden content, etc. 

Example story: ["Listen to Rihanna's New Single"](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelleydunlap/rihanna-reveals-new-music-arriving-tomorrow#.cw2x8QWpx) and how Buzzfeed knew it was a single. This one's silly, but there's an awful lot you can get by looking under the hood.

### Section 1: Review of last week's assignment
* Remember deadlines. I will cut off the ability to post after deadline in the future. It'll be as if you didn't do it.

I read all of the homework -- most of it good. The Seattle and Post ones were hard, since there was no IRE form.  I notice no one looked at the TV explosion -- why? 

#### Housekeeping:

Keep an eye on the schedule pretty regularly in the class folder on GitHub. 
The class web materials are at 
http://github.com/sarahcnyt/stabile 

Then look for the "skills" folder. You're welcome to browse around anything that's on there, but most of it is for the CAR class. 

Discussion of stories: 

* [Seattle Times' coverage](http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/8868) of officers shot
* [Hazard in the Heartland](http://ire.org/resource-center/stories/26249/)
* [Washington Post coverage of the Virginia Tech]( http://www.pulitzer.org/2014\_breaking\_news\_reporting\_finalist\_2) shootings

Next time when you're doing this, see if you can find more information about how the story was done so you don't have to speculate so much. I'm generally giving you well-documented stories. 
(Sorry about the confusion on Fort Meade vs. Virginia Tech. Either one would have been good.)

One thing that we didn't discuss in detail is timing: breaking news, deadline, there is no opportunity to request public records. They have weeks if not months to give them to you, so if you have to start from scratch you won't get them. Instead, they are finding public records online. Did anyone find the interview with the Seattle times' folks in which they talk about how they were lucky it was Arkansas, and that someone had already gotten those records? Or soemthing? I know I've heard them talk about it. 

Examples, though , of ways you could learn more: 
[Seattle Times](http://wanewscouncil.org/2010/06/23/anatomy-of-the-seattle-times%E2%80%99-pulitzer-prize/) editors talking about their story: http://wanewscouncil.org/2010/06/23/anatomy-of-the-seattle-times%E2%80%99-pulitzer-prize/

and a [story on Poynter](http://www.poynter.org/uncategorized/103954/how-the-virginia-tech-shooting-changed-the-washington-posts-reporting-and-online-publishing/) about how new the Post's use of social media was at the time -- people didn't have Facebook accounts yet!

### Section 3: Backgrounding on deadline

Reasons to have to background  on deadline:

* Find people to interview: witnesses to an accident; neighbors; relatives.
* Write about a previously unknown person who is thrust into the news.  
* Write about an event that intersects with government agencies (virtually all of them do): plane crashes; bridge failures; mass shootings; oil spills, etc.


Advanced Nexis and Factiva searching.  

Strategies:

* Use Doug Haddix's [librarian checklist](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3716/) from his presentation.
* Answer questions:
	* What do they say about themselves? (People, organization, agency, etc.)
	* What do others say about them?
	* What is left out?
	* What's confirmed or untrue?

Outside-in reporting: 

* As quickly as possible, identify all names used (middle, maiden, etc.) and DOB. You need this to know whether you  are likely talking about the same John Smith. 
* Nexis / Factiva search
* Social media accounts
* Nexis / Google News / Google Scholar
* Advanced Google search
* Other search engines

Now move to public records:

* Property records - using NYC finance dept.
* Court records - using NY State WebCivil.

Record what you've done and what you haven't -- what can you publish and what can't you? 

* Spreadsheet with source, link, etc. In the best of all worlds, you would print the copy of the web page to a PDF file, keep in on hand. Web sites change, especially social media sites that are associated with suddenly famous people. Record what you can publish, what needs confirmation, what is off the record or against your news organization's rules (we don't re-publish information from other news organizations without permision). I use Evernote's browser plug in to copy an image of the page to my Evernote account.

* Don't get side-tracked. You need to stay focused on what you are doing TODAY. Leave the deep research for another day.


### Section 4: In class
We'll do an exercise of backgrounding in an hour. We'll see where we are at the end of class -- I want everyone to feel like they got some experience without getting overwhelmed. The homework will to be to spend 1 more hour (not more than that) and then turn it in.
