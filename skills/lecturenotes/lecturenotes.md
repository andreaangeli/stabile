### Review of deadline reporting exerices ###
* Lots of people did a nice job on a short deadline, using Nexis and some other ways to get at secondary sources. That's fine -- on deadline you can't always get the public record. 
* Jenny was able to go further - share her spreadsheet.
* A couple of things I would disagree with , and we should talk. I may be wrong -- esp. when you talk about publishing information you find on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Pros and cons? 

### Discussion of final project ###
Due the last day of class.
Start thinking now about it.
