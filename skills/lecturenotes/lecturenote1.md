####Introductions

#### Investigative skills: 

what are they? What will we be working on this semester? Primarily how to go beyond the interview and comments from officials to dig into a topic, a person, an organization or a government program. 

Topics: 
* Documents - what are they and what are they good for?
* Backgrounding on deadline. 
* Using public records for beat reporting
* Using public records for project reporting
* Applying what you've learned

####"Documents state of mind"####
* "Assume a document" or database when you investigate government. Someone, somewhere, probably wrote it down, or there was some official record.
* Your life in records. 

#### Types of sources in investigative reporting 

##### People v. documents
* advantages of people over documents: 
	* details not easily boiled down
	* vivid
	* spontaneous sometimes
* advantages of documents over people
	* contemporaneous
	* un-biased by future events or new information
	* often form-based, so more consistent.


##### Private vs. public vs. non-existent.

* What is a record? What isn't a record? 
* Private vs. government records
* Government vs. public records

Think of a block with 4 squares

    
    	In private hands, 		In govt hands, 
		confidential			confidential
		
		In private hands		***In govt hands, 
		publicly accessible		avail for public inspection***


#### reading 
Bell, Calif: Discuss the idea of standard records that people can look at. If no one is watching, what happens? 
Brainstorm about how you'd do this. Government bodies: the most basic kind of public record, should be available everywhere, even in most other countries. You may or may not be able to get salaries elsewhere. 

### exercise
Exercise in class, in groups of 3: Choose one person to describe your day last Sunday. Throw in something that might not be exactly true. As a group, brainstorm 5 sources -- a mix of interviews, public sources, and perhaps government documents that might help confirm the story, and might help shed some doubt on the exaggeration or the lie. 

After review: Which of these would you consider "reliable" sources? Are some what are considered primary (a person who was there, or a document created at the moment) and others secondary (a person who was told the story, a story on a news site, etc.?)

Let's list primary vs. secondary sources you came up with, along with the class's perceived reliability.


### Understanding Freedom of Information laws
(In the realm of: in govt hands, available for public inspection. Often NOT available on the website.)
* National vs. state records - where to file.
* What's covered in public records laws?
* Where do you find records, and how do you know what to ask for?

### Maybe: Planning and conceiving an investigative story

* Compared to what?
* Minimum / maximum evaluation
* Impact vs. difficulty
* Victims

#### Strategy
Strategy for thinking about how to document an event, a person, an organization or a trend:

* What do primary actors say about themselves? (online, in person, in resumes, etc.)
* What do others say about them? (court cases, competitors, ...)
* What's missing from both accounts? Is there a gap that needs to be filled in, be it time, place or something else? (eg, Mitt Romney and his high school years) 
* What has been mischaracterized by one or another source?
Note that people often don't do this on purpose. This is their view.
