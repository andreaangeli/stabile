# Week 4 lecture notes 

## Review of FOIA requests
* Go over them in class, one by one. Discuss. Questions: 
	* How did you find the name of the record?
	* How much do you expect back? 
	* What do you think will be redacted or withheld?
	* How could you improve your chances of getting it back? 
	
We'll discuss each one, since learning from one another is useful way to get broader experience.

## Review of reading

* Compare the methods used in the three stories. 
* Which parts are convincing and not? 
* Discuss specific sections.

## Introduction to investigative projects 
[Presentation from class](http://slides.com/sarahcnyt/columbia-masters/#/)  

* Overview of reporting for projects, both using traditional methods and empirical journalism.

  Look at today's NYT - Jason Horowitz, a great biographer, has a piece on Ted Cruz's debate club at Princeton. Talk about how he looks for these kinds of stories -- a method that a lot of good reporters use, by looking for holes in what we know. A similar story is about a bullying incident during  [Mitt Romney](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html)'s prep school school days. He said that in all the coverage of Romney, he had not seen anything that delved into that part of his life. The debate club fits that pattern, too. 
  

* Include "computer-assisted" reporting / data journalism as project reporting. 

## In class: Story ideas and review of final assignment
You have a 1-page memo due next week suggesting an in-depth documents, or data-based story idea. You should know what you think it will show, where you will get the data, and how you will get it.

You should outline the story idea and the main example that prompted it (if there is one); what public records you would use and what they would contribute to the story. How would the use of documents and data improve your anecdotal story, or supply proof (or non-proof) of your underlying premise? 


###An example

> What the Story will Explore:

> Ricardo Martinez, of Brentwood, New York, died while working on a construction site in Astoria, Queens. I want to know the details about Martinez’s death, what his status was in the U.S. and whether he has family in New York. I also want to know whether the construction employer Abacus Building Innovations Inc. followed proper safety protocols in the workplace. I want to know how many workers have died while working in construction in New York City over the past two years, the reasons for their deaths and whether or not their employers were in violation of safety in the workplace.

> Public Records to Request: 
> I will contact OSHA and ask them for inspection information forms pertaining to the employers who were responsible for the safety of their workers who died in New York construction sites, including Ricardo Martinez’ employer. I will contact NYC’s Building Department to ask for the permits of the construction sites where these workers died.

> Public Records Contributions: 
> The inspection information from OSHA and the building permits from NYC’s Building Department will tell me the details of whether the employers were in violation of safety in the workplace and if they were indeed responsible for the lives of the workers 
 
Discuss.
