# Week 3: Public records and beat reporting

Look at the [lecture notes](lecturenotes.md) to see what we'll talk about, use this as your guide to public records.

### Handouts 


* Three handouts on how to find the records that might help your story, which is the hardest part of the process:
 
	* [Records Guesses to Gets](findingdocs3.pdf?raw=true)
	* [Finding Records on Your Beat](beatrecords.pdf?raw=true)
	* [Avoiding Delays and Denials](foia-delay-denial.pdf?raw=true)
<br><br>


* A couple of presentations I’ve made in the past suggesting a strategy for working through records, one for [federal](federal-foia-basics.pdf?raw=true) and one for [state](statehouse_sep09.pdf?raw=true). I’ll go through one of them in class. The state level one is on North Carolina, but the same idea works in other states. That lets you try New York.

### Resources
* [Reporters' Committee for the Freedom of the Press](http://rcfp.org) has a number of resources, including [iFOIA](http://iFOIA.org) to help you submit and manage your requests; the [Open Government Guide](http://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide) which compares each state's public records laws, and provides a guide for common records; and the same type of guide for [federal FOIA](http://www.rcfp.org/federal-open-government-guide).


* Several repositories of public records can help you see what others have asked for, including [Muckrock](http://muckrock.com), the [National Security Archive](http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchive/nsa/foia.htm) and a new federal [FOIA web portal from EPA](http://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home) that contains requests from several agencies 

### Two examples, both federal

* A [simple request](aroostook.pdf?raw=true) for minutes of a meeting

* A [complex request](annotated-foia-appeal.pdf?raw=true), annotated, with an appeal for a difficult dataset. (We'll return to this in our last week)
