Lecture notes, Sept. 17

####Introductions

####What are documents good for?

* Why might this be a better way to know how good someone's memory is or are they spinning?
	* Example of weather: How might you know whether a hurricane survivor remembers accurately, or is exaggerating? 
	* Example: memory of a doctor's visit. 

* When might you use people vs. documents for a story? 
* When might you us documents vs. people for a story? 

####"Documents state of mind"####

* Something is written down somewhere in a contemporaneous account
* Your life in records. Try to write down what they might be. 

Private vs. public vs. non-existent.

* What is a record? What isn't a record? 
* Private vs. government records
* Government vs. public records

#### reading 
Bell, Calif: Discuss the idea of standard records that people can look at. If no one is watching, what happens? 
Brainstorm about how you'd do this. Government bodies: the most basic kind of public record, should be available everywhere, even in most other countries. You may or may not be able to get salaries elsewhere. 

### exercise
Before you can get used to the idea of where to find records, or how to prove something, you have to be facile at identifying what a fact is that is check-able. Split into groups of 2 each, tell each other a story about yourself, then figure out what facts need to be checked. Think about how you might go about it? 

#### Strategy
Strategy for thinking about how to document an event, a person, an organization or a trend:

* What do primary actors say about themselves?
* What do others say about it?
* What is missing from either account?
* What has been mischaracterized?

Note that people often don't do this on purpose. This is their view.
