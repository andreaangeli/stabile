# Beat documents and data 
<p> I realize that I didn't really go over what was on the schedule, but instead worked on public records requests and public records laws. So you don't really have good beat reporting resources. </p>

Look at the following handouts and resources on beat reporting and typical documents you might find on different beats: 

### Crime and criminal justice
* [Unexpected Sources](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3394/download/?fileid=4214) (John Diedrich,  2010)
* [On the beat: law enforcement](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4184/download/?fileid=4143), Frances Robles
* [Criminal Justice Journalists](http://crimjj.wordpress.com/) website and resources list all kinds of records and techniques for covering the beat

##### Standard data and documents:

* Crime incident reports
* 911 calls
* Arrest reports
* Search warrants
* Court dockets and court files


### Local government
* ["Free the data"](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/4224/download/?fileid=4186), a tipsheet for requesting data from local governments
* ["Uncovering Waste and Fraud in Local Governments"](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3564/download/?fileid=3366), Andrew Donohue, now at the Center for Investigative Reporting. 
* ["On the beat: Government"](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3719/download/?fileid=3597), Andy Hall

##### Standard data and documents:
* Correspondence to and from the mayor or county executive
* Calendars of high-level officials
* Phone books, salaries of all public employees
* Budgets (or, if you want to get ambitious, an electronic version of the checkbook)
* Minutes of council meetings
* Campaign contributions of public officials
* Lobbying reports (sometimes)
* Conflict of interest / financial disclosure statements
* Audits and Inspector General reports
* Contracts and grants
* Property records

### Non-profits
"[Documents and tools for investigating nonprofits](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3922/download/?fileid=3919)", Kendall Taggart and Kris Hundley

##### Standard data and documents 
* IRS 990 reports
* Grants from local and federal agencies.
* Audits on grants

### Other beats
For other beats, look up the beat on IRE's website under "[tipsheets](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/)". IRE's "[Investigative Reporting Handbook](http://store.ire.org/collections/books/products/the-investigative-reporters-handbook-5th-edition)" also has beat-specific suggestions and standard records, but it's expensive ($48 for IRE members)
