##Lecture Notes<br>Sept. 24, 2014

[Tip sheet](backgrounding.md) is in this folder.

### Section 1: Review of last week's assignment
* Remember deadlines. I will cut off the ability to post after deadline in the future. It'll be as if you didn't do it.
* Remember grammar / usage. This isn't a writing class, but you should get used to writing at a professional level in all of your work. (I'm one to talk...)

Question: I asked everyone to keep an eye out for clues of public records -- remember the sticker on the fire extinguisher? My story about the "federal law" requiring handicapped and elderly reserved seats? What did you see this week?

I read all of the homework -- most of it good. The Seattle and Post ones were hard, since there was no IRE form. Some read it more carefully than others. I'll release individual comments to you today or tomorrow. (Wed-Thur)

Discussion of stories: 

* [Seattle Times' coverage](http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/8868) of officers shot
* [Hazard in the Heartland](http://ire.org/resource-center/stories/26249/)
* [Washington Post coverage of the Virginia Tech]( http://www.pulitzer.org/2014\_breaking\_news\_reporting\_finalist\_2) shootings

<h4 style="text-decoration:underline;"> Review types of sources and documents</h4>

The homework suggested that we're not entirely clear what types of sources are what. Review type and what you can do with them. 

* *Human sources*: Spokesmen, witnesses, actors in the process.What biases and distractions do they bring to the story? What is the motivation? 
* *Secondary sources*: News reports in particular, references to original documents or interviews through others. Getting public records from sources other than the government or source that created them is considered a secondary source (eg, Nexis search of public records, or court document provided on another website).
* *Primary sources*: Official documents, notes and records created at the time of an event for a business reason. Examples: court records (to administer justice); property records (to buy and sell property); birth records (to record your arrival in the world, ascertain citizenship). 
* *The special case of social media*: somewhere in between, because it might be a primary source, but it also isn't official and can be made up.

We have to credit / source secondary sources. We have to confirm social media and human sources. We can normally publish what we find in official primary sources, but you have to be very careful to make sure you have confirmed that it refers to the right person.

### Backgrounding on deadline

Reasons to have to background  on deadline:

* Find people to interview: witnesses to an accident; neighbors; relatives.
* Write about a previously unknown person who is thrust into the news.  
* Write about an event that intersects with government agencies (virtually all of them do): plane crashes; bridge failures; mass shootings; oil spills, etc.

We'll concentrate on backgrounding people today. I want to walk through a couple of sources that are a little difficult to navigate if you never have before: 

* Property records - using NYC finance dept.
* Court records - using NY State WebCivil.

Also go through the good way to search Nexis: more precise than Google. 

Then go through a strategy for outside-in reporting: 

* Social media accounts
* Nexis / Google News / Google Scholar
* Advanced Google search
* Other search engines

Now move to public records:

* As quickly as possible, identify all names used (middle, maiden, etc.) and DOB. 
* Use Doug Haddix's [librarian checklist](http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3716/) from his presentation.

Record what you've done and what you haven't -- what can you publish and what can't you? 

* Spreadsheet with source, link, etc. In the best of all worlds, you would print the copy of the web page to a PDF file, keep in on hand. Web sites change, especially social media sites that are associated with suddenly famous people. Record what you can publish, what needs confirmation, what is off the record or against your news organization's rules (we don't re-publish information from other news organizations without permision).

* Don't get side-tracked. You need to stay focused on what you are doing TODAY. Leave the deep research for another day.
	

### In class
We'll do an exercise of backgrounding in an hour. We'll see where we are at the end of class -- I want everyone to feel like they got some experience without getting overwhelmed. I may ask them to spend 1 more hour (not more than that) and then turn it in. 

Post readings for beat reporting.
