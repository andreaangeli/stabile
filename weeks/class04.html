       <h4>Before class</h4>
        <h5>Reading</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/temporary-work-lasting-harm">"Temporary Work, Lasting Harm"</a> by Michael Grabell, Olga Pierce and Jeff Larson, ProPublica, 2013. Presented by Joanna Bernstein.</li>
          <li><a href="http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/truancy/index.html">"An Empty Desk Epidemic"</a> by David Jackson, Gary Marx and Alex Richards, Chicago Tribune, 2012. Presented by Melissa Hirsch.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Review videos (and the handouts in Resources)</h5>
        <p>Your background in Excel will determine how much of these tutorials you feel you need to review.
        You are expected to know how to filter data tables, create a pivot table with comparative percentages,
        do math on dates and times, and use formulas to split a name and look up a value. Each of these
        tutorials focuses on a different skill. Look at the resources below for compilations of tip sheets
        that will review the ideas for you.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using Excel as a database: Filtering and pivot tables.</li>
          <li>Advanced Excel skills: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-DLkeHnb_g">lookups</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/AuCWaM2ez7o">date math</a></li>
          <li>Advanced Excel skills: ranking and grouping into categories</li>
        </ul>
        
        
       <h4>In class</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Reading presentations</li>
        <li>Demonstration of some things you'll know how to do by the end of the semester</li>
        <li>Lab on story memo or Excel skills -- students' choice</li>
        <li>Example data set: <a href="../docs/IowaPrimaryResults.xlsx">Iowa Republican primary results</a></li>
       </ul>
       
       <h4>Resources</h4>
       <h5>Tip sheets for spreadsheets</h5>
       <ul>
        <li>Mary Jo Webster's <a href=http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3346/">
        "My Favorite (Excel) Things"</a> handout, a classic.
        <li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26514347/tutorials/xlpivot_updated.pdf">
        Filtering and pivot tables in Excel</a>. This is for Windows, so it will look a little different than on your
      screen, but the concepts are the same.</li>
        
       </ul>
       <h5>Extra exercises</h5>
       You might want to go over a couple of exercises to get you used to the concepts. IRE's educator's
        resource center has some <a href="http://ire.org/nicar/database-library/practice-data-sets/excel/">archived practice datasets and guides</a>. They use an old version of Excel,
        so they'll look different than yours. But the ideas as ones that you'll want to understand. Use Piazza
        liberally to ask how to convert these guides to something more modern. The ones that will be best
        for this week for you are the school reports, the car phones (yes, they used to call cell phones "car
        phones" becuase they were too big to walk around with), and the pivot tables (excuse the use of the
        Redskins football team -- we'd probably use a different team today.)
