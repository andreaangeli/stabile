        <h5>Due Sunday, 5pm<h5>
        <p>Using the skills you learned over the past two weeks, analyze <a href="../docs/excel-memo-data.xlsx">this spreadsheet</a> and write a 2- to 5-paragraph lede for a story. You don't have to do any other reporting to get this far.
        (Of course, if you were to write a real story, you'd have to talk with people. This is just the newsworthy findings.) The spreadsheet has three sheets. The "documentation" sheet tells you
        what is in the other two and their sources. Review all of the materials under "Resources" below to see the kinds of things you'll have to know how to do. We would expect you to match
        the two sheets by their common identifier, deal with missing data, and create a pivot table with some comparisons. You might find that you have to do other things to answer questions. Please upload your story memo and your
        final spreadsheet to the Courseworks assignment. (You can write your memo in an attached file or in the text box online -- either one.)
