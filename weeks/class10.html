       <h5>Using visualization as a reporting tool</h5>
       <p>Visualization is an important part of your ability to see stories in your data. For this stage, you want to try a lot of tools 
       and a lot of views of your data, worrying less about the aesthetics and more about the revelations you might find. </p>
       <ul><li>A <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26514347/handouts/viz/viz-reporting.pdf">chapter</a> 
       written by Sarah for the <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/">Data Journalism Handbook</a> that never seemed to appear in the final version</li>
       <li>The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26514347/handouts/viz/viz_numbers_edits.pdf">draft re-write</a> of 
       the visualization as a reporting tool chapter from Numbers in the Newsroom</li>
       
       <li>Nathan Yau has a great website called <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a> 
       of examples that help you see what is a useful and not-so-useful visualization. His book,
       <a href="http://book.flowingdata.com/">Visualize This: The FlowingData Guide to Design, Visualization and Statistics</a>
       	 has some great tutorials.</li>     
       <li>Edward Tufte may be the father of modern thinking on visualizing data. His book, <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">
       	"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"</a> might be found on the bookshelves
       	of almost every graphic artist.</li>  
       	</ul>
       	<h5>Tools for visualization (we'll hit mapping and GIS later in the semester)</h5>
       	<ul>
       	<li>Most people swear by R's graphics -- the single best reason to learn the language. <a href="http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html">
       	GGPLOT2</a>, created by Hadley Wickham, is a versatile way to create
       	charts from almost any form of data. There are plug-ins that can turn them into interactive graphics.</li>
       	<li><a href="http://tableausoftware.com">Tableau</a> and Tableau Public are supposed to come to Macs in the "2nd quarter" of this year. There are mixed feelings about 
       	whether it's worth the learning curve, but it's a little less daunting than starting in on programming. Your IRE membership
       	entitles you to a free copy of the desktop version, which usually costs about $2,000. Here are some <a href="http://www.ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3834/">
       	handouts from IRE</a> to get you started. (You have to be logged into IRE to get them.) <br><br>Just a warning: once you have created your visualization,
       	it's hard to share the desktop version with your colleagues. The Public version is public to everyone. So it may not be the right answer for a lot of
       	projects.</li>
       	<li>While Excel's graphics are, well, unhelpful, it has one feature that can be very useful: an implementation of Tufte's <a href="http://www.excel-easy.com/examples/sparklines.html">
       	sparklines</a> -- small, word-size graphics that help you distinguish patterns from a chart of numbers. </li>
       	<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery">Google Charts</a> and their cousin, 
       	<a href="http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#fusiontables">Google Fusion Tables</a>, 
       	can help you create quick charts from small, simple statistical summaries. This usually isn't that useful
       	during the reporting stage, but can be easier than some of the alternatives. Getting your data into shape means creating a JSON file from your csv or Excel sheet.
       	Try using Shan Carter's <a href="http://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/">Mr. Data Converter</a> for that chore.</li>
       	<li><a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">D3</a> is a Javascript library created by Mike Bostock, now of the New York Times. It's the successor to Protovis,
       	which was created in the Stanford Visualization Lab. Although intimidating, if you're good at Javascript and can follow examples, it's probably the most 
       	versatile visualization tool.</li>
       	<li><a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/">Simile Exhibit</a> is a project out of MIT. It's good for simple maps and interactive timelines, especially when you want to filter small datasets at the same
       	time. You may need Mr. Data Converter for this, too.</li>
       	<li>The missing link in exploratory visualization is a way to view timelines and calendars for chronologies. We took a stab at this at Duke University, enlisting 
       	the visualization geniuses Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas to create a prototype tool called <a href="https://github.com/FlowingMedia/TimeFlow/wiki">TimeFlow</a>. 
       	It's rough -- make sure to keep backups of your data in Excel -- but it can be useful for exploration
       	
       	
       	
       	</ul>
