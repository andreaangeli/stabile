       <h4>Before class</h4>
       <p><span class="red">Reading</span> TBD</p>
       <p><span class="red">Watch the best practices tutorial</span></p>
       <p><span class="red">Watch the numbers in the newsroom lecture</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight:bold";>Due Sunday, 5pm:</span> Read enough of this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/akfjno867qvbdcq/internal-affairs-report.pdf">internal affairs report</a> to know what kinds of information it contains about an investigation into domestic violence incidents involving Halford "Bubba" Harris II of the St. John's County Sheriff's Office. </p>
       <p>Create a spreadsheet using the concepts in the best practices tutorial that will allow you to track the events in the report. Think about how you will want to use it and what you would need to fact-check on deadline. You don't have to map out the whole thing, but you should enter enough (say, 20 rows) to be able to test any analysis you want to do, incluidng sorting and fact-checking. </p>
       <p>Email me spreadsheet and a 3-paragraph memo describing what else you would need to know before you could say how newsworthy this report is.</p>
       <p>I'll post the <span class="red">actual spreadsheet</span> I created for this case after deadline.</p>

       <h5>Choosing data stories </h5>
       <ul><li>
       <a href="http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3696/">Another great handout</a> from Mike Berens, this time on choosing stories.</li>
       <li>USA Today's Alison Young's <a href="<a href="http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3593/">slide show </a> and <a href="http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/3508/download/?fileid=3308">tipsheet</a> on generating investigative ideas</li>
       <li><a href="http://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=%2Bcar+%2Bideas">IRE's resource center query</a> for "car" + "ideas".</li>
       <li><a href="http://slid.es/sarahcnyt/proving-an-investigative-hypothesis">Proving and investigative hypothesis</a>, a presentation for Columbia's summer investigative seminar. A <span class="red">narrated version</a> is also available.</li>

       <h5>Going further with the internal affairs report</h5> 
       <ul>
       <li>Try putting your spreadsheet into a timeline using one of the more common tools. You could try Simile Exhibit; you can try an experimental tool created at Duke University called TimeFlow, or you can try the Javascript library TimelineSetter from Propublica.</li>
      <li>Sign up for DocumentCloud, and upload the report to a private repository. Use its highlighting and commenting capability to  annotate the document. Look at its analytics to find names, dates, and places.</li>
