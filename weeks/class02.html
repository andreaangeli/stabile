       <h4>Before class</h4>
       <p><span class="red">Reading</span> TBD</p>
       <p><span class="red">Watch the best practices tutorial</span></p>
       <p><span class="red">Watch the numbers in the newsroom lecture</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-weight:bold";>Due Sunday, 5pm:</span> Read enough of this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/akfjno867qvbdcq/internal-affairs-report.pdf">internal affairs report</a> to know what kinds of information it contains about an investigation into domestic violence incidents involving Halford "Bubba" Harris II of the St. John's County Sheriff's Office. </p>
       <p>Create a spreadsheet using the concepts in the best practices tutorial that will allow you to track the events in the report. Think about how you will want to use it and what you would need to fact-check on deadline. You don't have to map out the whole thing, but you should enter enough (say, 20 rows) to be able to test any analysis you want to do, incluidng sorting and fact-checking. </p>
       <p>Email us a link to your spreadsheet on Dropbox, and a 3-paragraph summary of what else you would need to know before you could say how newsworthy the report is.</p>
       <p>I'll post the <span class="red">actual spreadsheet</span> I created for this case after deadline.</p>
       
       <h4>In class</h4>
       <p> Discussion of the reading</p>
       <p> Discussion of the homework</p>
       <p> Initial work on your story memo</p>

       <h5>Going further with the internal affairs report</h5> 
       <ul>
       <li>Try putting your spreadsheet into a timeline using one of the more common tools. You could try Simile Exhibit; you can try an experimental tool created at Duke University called TimeFlow, or you can try the Javascript library TimelineSetter from Propublica.</li>
      <li>Upload the report DocumentCloud and use its highlighting and commenting capability to  annotate the document. Look at its analytics to find names, dates, and places.</li>
       </ul>
       
       <h5>Spreadsheet skills review</h5>
       <ul>
        <li><a href="../docs/Excelbest.pdf">Tip sheet</a> from best practices lecture as a reminder</li>

        <li><a href="../docs/Excelformats.pdf">Formatting your sheet</a> for efficiency and data integrity</li>

        <li>Chad Skelton's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efFDOmman2tXRhDKXgvOmfAqLtH1rifNEFDsvbx0StY/edit?usp=sharing">list of tips</a>, culled from IRE resources and the NICAR-L listserv</li>
       </ul>

        Many of these resources are derived from the book Sarah wrote in 1999 called Numbers in the Newsroom: Using Math and Statistics in News. It's available from IRE, but a new e-version should be available soon.
