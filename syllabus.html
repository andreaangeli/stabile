</a>Course description</h2>
        <p>Maurice Tamman of Reuters calls it the &quot;empirical spine&quot; of journalism. In an earlier generation, Philip Meyer called it &quot;Precision Journalism.&quot; A lot of people still call it &quot;computer-assisted reporting,&quot; and it's become a specialty within the broader data journalism movement. But whatever you want to call it, original reporting using analyses of documents and databases is one of the most powerful tools you can add to your investigative reporting kit. </p>
        <p>I can ask my database to quickly check a tip. I can use it to find more examples. I can mash it up with other data and find patterns that officials and other experts might never see. I can document the seemingly impossible pattern. </p>
        <p>My computer doesn't complain when I ask it more questions, and I don't need to wait for it to call me back. It only lies when I make a mistake. And it will repeat my instructions hundreds or even millions of times without pause.</p>
        <p>During this class, you will learn to: 
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize opportunities for broadening and deepening your stories using original reporting methods on databases and document collections.</li>
        <li>Use some of the more common tools in computer-assisted reporting, such as spreadsheets and relational databases.</li>
        <li>Harvest data from unlikely sources, including the deep web and pdfs.</li>
        <li>Master some analytic techniques that can be used in a variety of sources</li>
        <li>Synthesize your data reporting, and integrate it with your street reporting</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

<a class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
</a>Requirements</h2>
<p>You'll have three deliverables each week. 
<ol><li>Reading a story or set of stories that feature computer-assisted reporting</li>
<li>Pre-reading and tutorials for the skill we'll practice in class</li>
<li>Write-up of the exercise for the week. This will be due at midnight after the class day, meaning you will have the rest of the day to finish it.</li>
</ol>
You will also have two small projects during the course of the semester:
<ol><li>A critique of a story you find on your own accompanied by a 15-minute presentation and discussion with the class. You have to choose the story at least a week before you present so it can be assigned as reading for the rest of the class. You'll consult with me on your choice.</li>
<li>A story memo you develop based on an analysis of some data you find on your own</li>
</ol>
<p>You're expected to come to class every week prepared to discuss the stories assigned and to work on the analysis for your weekly memo. We may have short demos or lectures in between the discussion and the lab, depending on the difficulty of what is being taught.</p>
<p>There are no excused absences other than a true emergency or incapacitating illness. Visiting your parents or going on a ski trip or planning an interview for another class is a choice - you have decided it's more important than this class. It might be a rational choice, but it's not an emergency. </p>

Finally, this is a journalism class. That means all work is your own or your team's, and plagiarism will not be tolerated.
